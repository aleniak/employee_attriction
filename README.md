My first promt:


      Build a complete Employee Attrition Prediction web app with:
      - TensorFlow.js for real ML predictions
      - Chart.js for data visualizations  
      - CSV file upload and analysis
      - Modern responsive UI
      - Working "Run Comprehensive EDA" button
      - Neural network training interface
      - Real-time risk predictions
      
      Provide full index.html and app.js files.
      
      Here is the dataset and it's description with the description of the problem
      
      Problem Statement
      We need to built a prediction system for the employee attriction in order to decrease the level of embloyee attriction in the company by working with each employee individually.
      
      Data Description
      The dataset consists of 14710 observations and 8 variables. Each row in dataset represents an employee; each column contains employee attributes:
      
      Independent Variables were:
      Age: Age of employees,
      Department: Department of work,
      Distance from home,
      Education: 1-Below College; 2-College; 3-Bachelor; 4-Master; 5-Doctor;
      Education Field
      Environment Satisfaction: 1-Low; 2-Medium; 3-High; 4-Very High;
      Job Satisfaction: 1-Low; 2-Medium; 3-High; 4-Very High;
      Marital Status,
      Monthly Income,
      Num Companies Worked: Number of companies worked prior to IBM,
      Work Life Balance: 1-Bad; 2-Good; 3-Better; 4-Best;
      Years At Company: Current years of service in IBM
      Dependent Variable was:
      Attrition: Employee attrition status(0 or 1)


After this promt Deepseek gave me the working prototype of my app, but it lacked EDA. So, then I asked it to add more EDA to the application:

      Please add more EDA analysis data - various data graphs and charts. 

Then app stopped showing resulrs of the EDA analysis and I have written this promt:

      Please make the "Run Comprehensive EDA" button work. You removed the function call on button click from the index.html file.

Unfortunately, Deepseek was unable to fix this issue, so I fixed it myself.

Then, I gave Deepseek an ipynb file, in whic I created, trained and tested several ML models and asked Deepseek to integrate the best model into the app.js in order to implement real ML model for my application. For this I used this promt:

      I've prepared several machine learning models. Their results are here, along with a discussion of the training algorithm and information on the number of epochs, etc.
      
      Please integrate the best model into the epp.js file so that the data in the app is predicted by a real ML model.
